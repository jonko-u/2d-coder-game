#### Introduction:
- **Title Slide:**
  - Game Title: Code Runner
  - Subtitle: A 2D Platformer for Software Engineers

- **Introduction (Slide 1):**
  - Briefly introduce the concept of the game: A 2D platformer inspired by Mario Bros, with a twist for software engineers.

- **Game Concept (Slide 2):**
  - Describe the main concept:
    - Players control a software engineer character.
    - Collect programming language tokens instead of coins.
    - Defeat bugs instead of enemies.
    - Navigate through levels inspired by the software development world.

#### Features:
- **Key Features (Slide 3):**
  - Highlight the key features of the game:
    - Software engineer protagonist.
    - Collectible programming language tokens.
    - Bug enemies.
    - Levels inspired by software development themes.

- **Gameplay (Slide 4):**
  - Describe the gameplay:
    - Platformer mechanics with jumping and running.
    - Tokens as the main collectibles.
    - Different types of bugs as adversaries.
    - Challenging levels with software-related obstacles.

- **Programming Language Tokens (Slide 5):**
  - Explain the significance of tokens:
    - Different tokens representing various programming languages.
    - Collecting tokens increases your "coding power."
    - Coding power can be used for special abilities.

- **Enemies (Slide 6):**
  - Introduce the bugs:
    - Types of bugs (e.g., syntax errors, runtime bugs).
    - How bugs affect gameplay and strategies to defeat them.

- **Levels (Slide 7):**
  - Showcase the levels:
    - Themes based on software development stages (e.g., coding, testing, deployment).
    - Each level presents unique challenges.

- **Challenges and Rewards (Slide 8):**
  - Discuss challenges:
    - Difficult platforming sections.
    - Puzzles related to coding concepts.
  - Rewards:
    - Completing levels unlocks new coding abilities.

#### Conclusion:
- **Conclusion (Slide 9):**
  - Summarize the presentation:
    - Code Runner is a unique 2D platformer designed for software engineers.
